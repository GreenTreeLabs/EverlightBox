EverlightBox has a very **social attitude**: users can share the image they're *currently* seeing and they can even write comments thanks to the Facebook comments widget.

EverlightBox is a very **fast** and **safe** lightbox for WordPress. It can be used with WordPress galleries like:

- WordPress native galleries
- [Final Tiles Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/final-tiles-grid-gallery-lite/)
- [Modula Grid Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/modula-best-grid-gallery/)
 
and any linked image. You can even activate it using custom CSS selectors, so it's virtually compatible with every gallery plugin.

EverlightBox is also a perfect solution for **mobile** devices, it supports swipe gestures so users are able to browse your images in a more natural way.
